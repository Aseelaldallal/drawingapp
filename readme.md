To run:
make run



What works:


* Drawing Doodles
* Changing Color and stroke size
* When clicking choose color, user gets to set custom color
* User can customize color palette 
* Double clicking any color allows you to replace that color with a custom color
* You can undock the left toolbar. Doesn't look great though when undocked
* You can save the file in: Binary, JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG
* You can open a file of type binary (deserialize object), jpg, bmp, gif, png. 
There's a small bug: if you click open file, and select binary, no binary files will appear. 
So if you want to load a binary file, ignore that option, just make sure it says "all files". 
* When clicking open, new, exit, user is prompted to save
* You can create new doodle
* You can exit


Not Complete:
* Playback Control: Not working as expected. Will fix at a later date. 
* Play Button: Not Implemented

Used MVC model.
